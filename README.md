# Paseo Action Submission (PAS) Repository
Welcome to the Paseo Action Submission (PAS) Repository, the central hub for all proposals, discussions, and documentation related to the development and governance of the Paseo testnet. This repository is designed to foster collaboration and transparency within the Paseo community, enabling contributors, developers, and stakeholders to participate in shaping the future of the Paseo network.

## Purpose
The Paseo Action Submission Repository serves as a structured platform for submitting, reviewing, and discussing proposals that impact the Paseo network's technical specifications, governance, features, and improvements. Our aim is to ensure that the Paseo testnet evolves in a way that meets the community's needs and adheres to high standards of quality and innovation.

## PAS workflow
The individuals involved in creating a PAS are:
1. The author of the PAS
2. the Paseo Governance Team (PGT) which are the signers on the sudo multisig

When creating a PAS, please use the following statuses in the title of your PAS - this allows the community to see which proposals have been implemented and which are still in discussion. Please update the status with a PR. 
* Draft -- This PAS is a work in progress
* Proposed -- This PAS has been submitted to the Paseo Governance Team for review
* Approved -- This PAS has been approved, but hasn't yet been implemented
* Rejected -- This PAS has been rejected by the Paseo Governance Team
* Implemented -- This PAS has been implemented

## How to Contribute
- Submitting a PAS: To propose a new feature or change, start by creating a PAS document.
- Discussion and Review: Once submitted, the community will review and discuss the proposal. Feedback and constructive criticism are encouraged to refine and improve the proposal.
- Decision Making: Proposals will be evaluated by the Paseo governance team. Decisions will be made based on community feedback, the proposal's merit, and alignment with Paseo's objectives.
- All PAS proposals must be public domain. See in the bottom of this document for an example copyright waiver.
