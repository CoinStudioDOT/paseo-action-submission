## Summary
This PAS documentes the process for requesting funds from the bounty for completed work, or work in advance. 

## Abstract
To run the Paseo testnet, many payments need to be made to individuals / groups / companies for their work running and maintaining the testnet. 
This PAS covers the processes for payments including frequency, budget tracking, transparency and reporting to the community. 

## Specification
### Overview
The bounty curators will be managing a bounty of 125,018 DOT, approx $850k USD at the time of submission. This DOT needs to be allocated to individuals based on their contribution to the network and as per documented in the treasury proposal. 

As per the proposal the breakdown in funds is as follows:

| Amount (DOT) | Amount (USD) | Allocation |
| ------------ | ------------ | ---------- |
| 61,773 DOT   | $420,000 USD | is allocated for 3x full time resources to maintain the protocol | 
| 44,609 DOT   | $303,300 USD | is allocated for nodes and management of them | 
| 3,309 DOT    | $22,500 USD  | is allocated for open source validator logging |
| 4,353 DOT    | $29,600 USD  | is allocated for block explorers |
| 1,588 DOT    | $10,800 USD  | is allocated for curation fees |
| 9,383 DOT    | $63,800 USD  | is allocated for contingency |

## Payment structure
Payments will be made to individuals quarterly in advance, over the 12-month funding period. This is tracked in a budget worksheet, documenting all payments made over the year.
In some cases there could be retroactive payments, if additional services were offered or increased during the quarter - e.g. a validator spun up additional nodes (at request), beyond the forecast amount. 

## Payout process
Given the nature of the bounty where many individuals or groups will require funding, it makes sense to manage this in a transparent way. 
2 weeks before the quarter end, any individuals / groups / companies are to create a new issue in the /payouts folder of the repo and use the following template to document their payment request:

Name: 
Contact details (tg/email/element):
Proponent: 
Requested DOT: 
Proactive / Retroactive payment: 
Description: 
Evidence: 

There should be one Issue created per payment request. 
This will be used by the curators to validate the work and individuals requesting funding. Rather than using a google form or a model centralised to one indiviudal, this way any of the curators can monitor and propose payments. 

At the start of the quarter, these requests will be paid out onchain to the individuals. 

#### Exceptions
There may be exceptions that arrise when one off, or monthly payments are required to be made - this is at the curators discression. 

## Curator fees
Following the [curator proposal] the curators will also be quarterly, retroactivly for the work they completed during the most recent payment run and any monthly / one off payments made during the quarter.
These will be paid to the curator multisig and then paid individually to the curators. 
This will also be recorded on the budget spreadsheet.
