## Summary
Communication template to be used for the Management team to communicate about the Runtime Upgrade Process

## Abstract
A short description of the proposed change, this should clearly describe the proposed change that will happen if this PAS is passed rather than why it should be done or the detail behind how to complete the changes. 

## Motivation
The motivation is used as the "why" of the PAS and should clearly explain why the current state of the protocol is inadequate. It is critical that you explain why the change is needed - especially if proposing a large change to the network.
