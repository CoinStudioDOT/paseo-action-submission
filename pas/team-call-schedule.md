### Introduction
This PAS proposes the implementation of a regular schedule for team calls within the paseo-network community. These calls are aimed at enhancing coordination, communication, and collaboration among team members. A set schedule will ensure regular and effective touchpoints for various aspects of the project.

### Proposed Schedule: 
The team call schedule will be as follows:

**Tuesdays - Core Team Call**

Purpose: To discuss core development updates, address technical challenges, and plan for upcoming features or changes.
Participants: Core development team and technical leads. (Zondax, R0GUE and Portico, @helloitsbirdo optional)
Time: 2 PM CET.
Frequency: Weekly.

**Thursdays - Fellowship Coordination Call**

Purpose: To review the progress made during the week, discuss any blockers or challenges, and align on the goals for the next week.
Participants: team members, project fellows, and invited guests (as applicable).
Time: 2 PM CET.
Frequency: Bi-Weekly (Each two weeks).
this meeting initially will be weekly until Rococo is shutdown and then we can move it to Bi-Weekly or even Monthly

### Call Format and Guidelines
- Each call will have a designated facilitator to guide the discussion.
- An agenda will be circulated at least 24 hours before the call.
- Team members are encouraged to add items to the agenda ahead of time.
- A summary of each call will be documented and shared with the team for reference and action points.
- Leave public notes if decisions were taken during the meet.

### Goals
- Enhanced Communication: Regular calls will ensure all team members are aligned and informed about the project's progress and challenges.
- Efficient Collaboration: Frequent meets will aid in quicker decision-making and problem resolution.
- Community Engagement: Monthly calls will provide an opportunity to engage with wider community members, gather feedback, and align on community-driven initiatives.

### Implementation
- A Google Calendar for the Paseo Network will be done so members can suscribe to it to be aligned with every Network Meet scheduled if they are able to join.
- Virtual meeting links (Zoom, Google Meet, etc.) will be included in the calendar invites.
- Reminders will be sent one day before each call.
