# Paseo Action Submission (PAS) Repository
Welcome to the Paseo Action Submission (PAS) Repository, the central hub for all proposals, discussions, and documentation related to the development and governance of the Paseo testnet. This repository is designed to foster collaboration and transparency within the Paseo community, enabling contributors, developers, and stakeholders to participate in shaping the future of the Paseo network.

## Purpose
The Paseo Action Submission Repository serves as a structured platform for submitting, reviewing, and discussing proposals that impact the Paseo network's technical specifications, governance, features, and improvements. Our aim is to ensure that the Paseo testnet evolves in a way that meets the community's needs and adheres to high standards of quality and innovation.

## How to Contribute
- Submitting a PAS: To propose a new feature or change, start by creating a PAS document.
- Discussion and Review: Once submitted, the community will review and discuss the proposal. Feedback and constructive criticism are encouraged to refine and improve the proposal.
- Decision Making: Proposals will be evaluated by the Paseo governance team. Decisions will be made based on community feedback, the proposal's merit, and alignment with Paseo's objectives.
