## Summary
Describe simply in a non technical way, the outcome the proposed change intends to achieve.

## Abstract
A short description of the proposed change, this should clearly describe the proposed change that will happen if this PAS is passed rather than why it should be done or the detail behind how to complete the changes. 

## Motivation
The motivation is used as the "why" of the PAS and should clearly explain why the current state of the protocol is inadequate. It is critical that you explain why the change is needed - especially if proposing a large change to the network. 

## Specification
### Overview
This is a high level overview of how the PAS will solve the problem. The overview should clearly describe how the new feature will be implemented.

### Rationale
This is where you explain the reasoning behind how you propose to solve the problem. The reasoning can include technical specifications if required. It should also document potential trade-offs or considerations in the proposal. This section of the PAS should expand on what motivated the design and why particular design decisions were made. It should describe alternate designs that were considered and related work. The rationale may also provide evidence of consensus within the community, and should discuss important objections or concerns raised during discussion.

### PAS README Update.

The PR for the PAS proposal must include the update to the README.md where all the PAS documents are listed.
